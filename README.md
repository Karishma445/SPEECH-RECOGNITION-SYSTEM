üìÑ Project Description: Speech Recognition System Using Pre-Trained Models
This project focuses on building a basic Speech-to-Text (STT) system using pre-trained models and open-source libraries such as SpeechRecognition and Wav2Vec2. The goal of the system is to convert short audio clips containing human speech into accurate, readable text. The task was completed as part of an internship project under CODTECH, with the deliverable being a functional prototype capable of handling real-world audio input.

The system was developed using Python, leveraging two powerful approaches for speech recognition. The first approach uses the SpeechRecognition library, which interacts with the Google Web Speech API. This is a simple and quick way to get started with speech recognition using cloud-based processing. The second approach involves using Wav2Vec2, a cutting-edge model developed by Facebook AI, which is accessed through the Hugging Face Transformers library. Wav2Vec2 provides offline transcription capabilities with high accuracy, especially on English language audio files.

üß† Task Summary
The task required the creation of a program that:

Accepts an audio file (preferably in .wav format).

Processes the file to extract and interpret spoken words.

Outputs the corresponding transcription in plain text format.

The audio files were limited to short durations (up to 30 seconds), ensuring quick and efficient testing. The system supports both cloud-based and offline model inference, offering flexibility for different use cases and environments.

üåç Applications of the Speech Recognition System
Speech recognition technology is widely used across various industries and domains. Some common applications include:

Virtual Assistants (like Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

Call Centers and Customer Support (for voice-to-text automation)

Accessibility Tools for individuals with disabilities (voice typing, screen readers)

Meeting Transcription in corporate environments

Educational Software for language learning and speech assessment

Medical Transcription for clinical documentation

Hands-free Interfaces in automobiles and smart devices

This system provides the foundation for integrating speech input into software, enabling more natural, voice-based human-computer interaction.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Platforms Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Python 3	Main programming language
SpeechRecognition	Cloud-based speech recognition (Google API)
pydub	Audio file format conversion and processing
transformers	Access to pre-trained models like Wav2Vec2
torchaudio/torch	Loading and resampling audio data for model input
Jupyter Notebook / IDEs	Development and testing environment

The system is cross-platform and can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, provided the required libraries are installed. No GPU is strictly necessary, though having one can accelerate Wav2Vec2 model inference.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This speech recognition system showcases how pre-trained models and open-source tools can be combined to build practical, real-world applications. It demonstrates the intern‚Äôs understanding of audio processing, machine learning, and Python development. This project serves as a stepping stone for more advanced systems involving real-time transcription, multi-language support, and voice command execution
